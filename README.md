# Simple-Linear-Regression-using-SPSS
Finding impact of brand favorability on brand recommendation by performing the Simple Linear Regression and decipher the strength and nature of this relationship.

Q5_1(Brand X brand favorability impact) is independent variable and Q7_1 (Brand X brand recommendation) is dependent variable.
Since we have one independent variable and one dependent variable, and both are interval scale so we will perform the Simple Linear Regression to built the relationship between these variables.
**Null Hypothesis H0:** There is no linear relationship between brand favorability for Band X with Brand recommendation for Brand X

The above table shows the summary of linear regression model build through SPSS using the given dataset, we can say there is moderate positive correlation between brand favorability and recommendation with **r = 0.620, p <0.001
And Since R squared is 0.385**, we can say that 38.5% variance in brand recommendation is explained by brand favorability for Band X.

For the regression, we can reject the null hypothesis and can say that there is nonzero slope coefficient, 0.788 that can describe the relation as p < 0.001 for Brand Favorability coefficient and moreover there is nonzero constant value that is -0.087, p = 0.014 (< 0.05).

**Brand Recommendation = -0.087 (constant) + 0.788 * (Brand Favorability)**

From the above equation, we can say that a unit change in Brand Favorability can impact the brand recommendation by 0.788, that if brand favorability increase by 1 unit the brand recommendation will increase by 0.788.
