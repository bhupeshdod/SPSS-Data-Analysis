# Simple-Linear-Regression-using-SPSS

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between brand favorability and brand recommendation for Brand X. Utilizing Simple Linear Regression analysis, this study aims to quantify how changes in brand favorability impact the likelihood of the brand being recommended.

## Objectives
- To determine the strength and nature of the relationship between brand favorability and brand recommendation.
- To develop a predictive model that quantifies this relationship for practical application.

## Methodology
- **Statistical Tool Used**: SPSS
- **Model**: Simple Linear Regression
- **Variables**:
  - Independent Variable: Brand X brand favorability (Q5_1)
  - Dependent Variable: Brand X brand recommendation (Q7_1)
- **Hypothesis**:
  - Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no linear relationship between brand favorability and brand recommendation for Brand X.

## Key Findings
- **Correlation**: A moderate positive correlation (r = 0.620) was found, indicating that as brand favorability increases, so does the likelihood of brand recommendation.
- **Variance**: The R-squared value is 0.385, suggesting that 38.5% of the variance in brand recommendation can be explained by brand favorability.
- **Regression Equation**: `Brand Recommendation = -0.087 (constant) + 0.788 * (Brand Favorability)`
- **Statistical Significance**: The p-values for both the slope coefficient and the constant are significant (p < 0.05), allowing for the rejection of the null hypothesis.
